# ChickenBot

ChickenBot is a Next.js project that implements a game where you chase a chicken. The twist? The Chicken is going to be part robot! It will utilizes machine learning to improve its evasive behavior based on your chasing patterns. This project is still a work in progress and is being built on the Nextjs react web framework and utilizes TypeScript and the Tailwind CSS styling library.
